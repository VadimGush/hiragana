# Repetition Server

**NOTE:** I'm planning on creating a separate project for the implementation of the server. So this directory will be probably moved to another repository.

Repetition server is an implementation of SRS which can be embedded in any web-app. It's a Node.js application written in TypeScript with usage of Express framework. It uses MongoDB to store all content and state of SRS for every user (as well as user information itself).
